# BetterBankStatements
 I disliked my printed bank's statements so I made my own
 
 What's this?
 -------------
 It's an utility that uses xsl to transform all bank sttements (camt 053 iso20022 xml files) in a folder to one html document.
 
 
 Why this?
 -------------
 My bank statements took 36 printed pages (most of them half blank). With BetterBankStatements I reduced same info to 9 pages. 
 
 
 How this?
 -------------
 Download and compile (I used VS2019), run BetterBankStatements.exe or use camt2Html.xsl

 Framework 4.0 was used on purpose, you may change it at will...
